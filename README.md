# Stickers Store
Sticker store built with React.js, implementing UI libraries, paypal payment processor, and consuming an API.<br><br>
This was my first project in React.js, I learned how to build components, route views and conceive a molecular design for the application.

## :gear: How does it work

:shopping: The stickers for sale are shown on the main screen, if you click on one of them it takes you to the details of each one (data consumed from the API), if you click on buy they are added to the cart.

:shopping_cart: Once in the cart, the products are added and the total amount of the purchase is returned. They can also be removed from it. Finally, if you click on the buy button, a pop-up opens to register with PayPal and make the purchase
